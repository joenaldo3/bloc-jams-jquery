# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app. The goal was to use jQuery to make a finished app, with the provided assets, that will be a fully functional music player.

User Stories include:
* display album information
* list the songs for an album
* include standard music controls for playing, pausing, skipping forward/backward, and adjusting the volume.
